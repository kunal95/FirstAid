        A heart attack is a medical emergency. Call your local emergency number if you think you or someone else is having a heart attack.
        <br />
        The average person waits 3 hours before seeking help for symptoms of a heart attack. Many heart attack patients die before they reach a hospital. The sooner the person gets to the emergency room, the better the chance of survival. Prompt medical treatment reduces the amount of heart damage.

           1. Have the person sit down, rest, and try to keep calm.
<br />2. Loosen any tight clothing.
            <br />3. Ask if the person takes any chest pain medication for a known heart condition, such as nitroglycerin, and help them take it.
            <br />4. If the pain does not go away promptly with rest or within 3 minutes of taking nitroglycerin, call for emergency medical help.
            <br />5. If an infant or child is unconscious and unresponsive, perform 1 minute of CPR.

        <span class="plainText">
            1. Do NOT leave the person alone except to call for help, if necessary.
            <br />2. Do NOT allow the person to deny the symptoms and convince you not to call for emergency help.
            <br />3. Do NOT wait to see if the symptoms go away.
            <br />4. Do NOT give the person anything by mouth unless a heart medication (such as nitroglycerin) has been prescribed.
