        Shock is a medical emergency in which the organs and tissues of the body are not receiving an adequate flow of blood. This deprives the organs and tissues of oxygen (carried in the blood) and allows the build-up of waste products. The most common cause of shock you may encounter is caused by severe blood loss (Hypovolaemic shock). Shock can easily lead to death if the cause is not treated urgently.
