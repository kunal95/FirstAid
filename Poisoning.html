        Poisoning is caused by swallowing, injecting, breathing in, or otherwise being exposed to a harmful substance. Most poisonings occur by accident.

        Immediate first aid is very important in a poisoning emergency. The first aid you give before getting medical help can save a person's life. </div>

           1. If the person has been exposed to poisonous fumes, such as carbon monoxide, get him or her into fresh air immediately.
<br />2. If the person swallowed the poison, remove anything remaining in the mouth.
            <br />3. If the suspected poison is a household cleaner or other chemical, read the label and follow instructions for accidental poisoning.
            <br />4. Follow treatment directions that are given by the poison control center.
            <br />5. If the poison spilled on the person's clothing, skin or eyes, remove the clothing. Flush the skin or eyes with cool or lukewarm water, such as by using a shower for 20 minutes or until help arrives.
            <br />6. Make sure the person is breathing. If not, start CPR and rescue breathing.
            <br />7. Take the poison container (or any pill bottles) with you to the hospital.
