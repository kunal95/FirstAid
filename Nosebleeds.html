        Most nosebleeds are not serious and can be handled by a first aid responder.  Most will stop on their own or with simple first aid actions. In some cases nosebleeds can indicate a more serious condition which may require ongoing medical attention.

        <span class="plainText">1. <b>Sit upright and lean forward</b> By remaining upright, you reduce blood pressure in the veins of your nose. This discourages further bleeding. Sitting forward will help you avoid swallowing blood, which can irritate your stomach. Have the victim spit out blood that collects in the back of the throat or mouth. <br/>2. <b>Pinch the nose firmly</b> Use your thumb and index finger to pinch your nostrils shut. Breathe through your mouth. Continue to pinch for 5 to 10 minutes. Pinching sends pressure to the bleeding point on the nasal septum and often stops the flow of blood. <br/>3. <b>To prevent re-bleeding</b>, don't pick or blow your nose and don't bend down for several hours after the bleeding episode. During this time remember to keep your head higher than the level of your heart.  </span>
